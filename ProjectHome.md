# Breakdown of diseases to MP terms and MP term set assignment to diseases #

## Summary ##

Here, we provide the source code for programs that break down human diseases into a set of constituent phenotypes or assign a human disease for a set of phenotypes. We applied the analysis program to phenotype annotations in MGI (http://www.informatics.jax.org/) and Europhenome (http://www.europhenome.org/), which is annotated using the MP ontology.

The project was developed at the MGU at MRC Harwell (http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/).


## Download ##

The source code is available as a zip file under the "Downloads" tab (http://code.google.com/p/disease-to-mp/downloads). This file also contains input files and a very brief documentation pdf file.
